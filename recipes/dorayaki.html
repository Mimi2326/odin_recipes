    <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
    <p><strong>Doraemon's</strong> favourite! Little me always thought the cakes were filled with Nutella.</p>
    <p>A classic Japanese confection, Dorayaki is a <strong>honey pancake sandwich</strong> filled 
        with a <strong>red bean paste</strong>. It’s wildly popular amongst children and adults 
        alike in Japan.</p>
    
    <h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell)</li>
        <li>⅔ cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp honey</li>
        <li>1⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1-2 Tbsp water</li>
        <li>neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, rice bran, canola, etc.)</li>
        <li>1.1 lb sweet red bean paste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><u>Steps</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <p><li>In a large bowl, combine the eggs, sugar, and honey. Whisk well 
            until the mixture becomes fluffy.</li></p>
        <p><li>Sift the flour and baking powder into the bowl with the egg 
            mixture and mix until combined. Put the bowl in the refrigerator 
            to rest the batter for 15 minutes.</li></p>
        <p><li>After resting, the batter should be relaxed and slightly smoother. 
            Now, stir in half of the water and check the consistency. 
            Add more of the measured water until you reach a pancake batter 
            consistency.</li></p>
        <p><li>Heat a large nonstick frying pan over low. When the pan is thoroughly 
            heated, increase the heat to medium low. Dip a paper towel
             in the vegetable oil and coat the bottom of the pan with the oil.
             Then, use another paper towel to remove the oil completely. 
             With a ladle or a small measuring cup, pour 3 Tbsp of the batter from 3 inches (8 cm) above the pan to create a 
             pancake that's 3 inches (8 cm) in diameter. Cook one pancake at a time.</li></p>
        <p><li>When you see the surface of the batter starting to bubble, 
            flip the pancake over and cook the other side. 
            When done, transfer it to a plate and cover it with a damp towel to 
            prevent it from drying out. Grease the pan between batches.</li></p>
        <p><li>Assemble the Dorayaki by making a sandwich using two pancakes and 
            the sweet red bean paste as filling. Put more red bean paste 
            in the center so the shape of the Dorayaki will be curved. Wrap the Dorayaki with plastic wrap until ready to serve.
        </li></p>
